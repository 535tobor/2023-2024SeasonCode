## What's new?
+ readme.md file was added to every folder
+ a java Target class was added to every folder under the operations folder

A Target class is the class that holds all infromation for that folder that needs to be used, mostly public variables that are shared in that folder. For example under the root of the operations folder there is a java class called, "Target_operations". This holds all varaibles for that folder, and other possible infromation that is targeted as public.
