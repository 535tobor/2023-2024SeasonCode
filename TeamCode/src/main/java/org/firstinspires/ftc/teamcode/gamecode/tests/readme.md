# Testing Codes
This is where Autonomous and TeleOp codes are placed for tests, these codes are not going to be ran in autonomous or TeleOp

When this code is not being used as a test, disable it by adding <red style="color: red">@Disable</red> to the code beneath <yellow style="color: yellow">@Autonomous</yellow> or <yellow style="color: yellow">@TeleOp</yellow>. The point of doing that is to make it so that when opening the driver station app there are not a bunch of test programs on there when they are not even in use.
